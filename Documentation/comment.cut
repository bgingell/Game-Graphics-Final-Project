 The authors would like to thank everyone who helped make this project almost a reality.
We'd like to thank mr.doobs, the guy who made Three.js without whom all of this, while still possible,
would have been a lot more work. Finally, we'd like to thank Angus Forbes and Lucas Ferreira for their
excellent course and guidance throughout. Additionally, we'd like to continue to wonder why sph doesn't work on windows, and hope that that isn't too big a deal.
